# Catalyst PMM
Proposals Mentors Marketplace - Cardano Catalyst
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/421502-48088

# Problem statement
Catalyst is hard, generate a good proposal, get it well ranked and voted could be a very daunting challenge, producing frustration, good people left the community and great ideas to become overlooked

# Describe your solution to the problem
Proposals Mentors Marketplace, aims to produce a solution to that problem, by connecting people, Proposers, Mentors and Collaborators can interact to maximize the impact of the proposals.


# The Solution

PMM proposes to add a system and methods to facilitate funded proposal, planning, team building, strategy design and execution, by enabling funded proposers to find help among skilled members of the Cardano's community that are willing to mentor projects and proposers. Working towards the achievement of outstanding results, value and increase the chances creating amazing, impactful and lovable products and outcomes.

Complementing and furthering the successfully funded Fund 6 and Fund 7 Proposals Mentors Marketplace and F7 New Members Engagement that joined our platform, this second phase proposal seeks to continuing adding new functionality to the platform and to enhance its capabilities after launching our first release in July (all three previous proposals are now completed)

## Catalyst Proposal LifeCycle

After our Discovery phase, we have identified three main stages of the Proposal Journey:

When a proposer enters the Cardano's Ecosystem and the Catalyst Project and wants to understand how she/he can be part of it, wether she/he has an idea for a proposal or not.
When a proposer wants to create a proposal and realize her/his idea, applying to a Catalyst Fund round.
When a proposer got her/his proposal funded and needs to deliver on the promises.

Our 1st phase, F6 funded proposal - Proposals Mentor Marketplace - aims to solve Stage 2 of the Proposal LifeCycle, and it is on track to deliver on that goal, after successful completion of the MVP1, which launched in May 2022 as a closed beta, to further test the system. 

Our funded F7 continuation proposal, enhanced our backend, data model and build the proper CI/CD infrastructure to be able to produce continuous learning and improvements, following our LEAN approach to generate value.


Also our funded F7 New members onboarding proposal, extended our model to cover Stages 1 and 3 of the Proposal LifeCyle, adding the TASKs entity and the Collaborators role to the marketplace.

This proposal intends to provide continuation and new enhancements to PMM, with three main objectives:

Incorporate new possibilities to the formalization of agreements between the participants, allowing to register more details and even attach a wallet for the payments. As this is a key element to make the platform more appealing and of value to all parties. (Exploring and paving the way for a potential embedded smartcontract).

Produce a reports section, with key performance metrics and statistics aimed for all parties to understand their efforts, their results and general KPIs to further improve their goal. We will also incorporate a Guidance section, with some metrics about past funds to be used as guidance on how to produce better proposals and testimonies on how to overcome main issues and roadblocks in Catalyst projects.

We will produce a second UX phase, to understand if the user personas, needs and pains detected are properly solved by the platform and also which ones are not yet covered, so we can plan to add them to the marketplace.

## Our Platform (PMM - Proposals Mentors Marketplace)

This platform was planned as a unique directory of ranked mentors and new members collaborators, that offer their help to proposal building, promotion and execution. Mentor, Proposer and Collaborator profile and success metrics are visible in the platform, with certain key attributes that help the proposer to select/be matched to the relevant mentors and collaborators who can help bring their ideas to become reality.

Mentors and Collaborators will be able to monetize their advice and help, should they desire and agree this with proposers. By agreeing with the proposers during the application process, a sort of 'coming together' to agreement. We see that this could be in the form of pre-funding payment, post funding payment, equity interest or some mix or other in kind payment. The platform will help facilitate the agreement process.

In this initial stage we are experimenting with this open option to learn what are the different monetization needs from the community. Now the platform could leverage smart contracts or detailed agreements to help with the transparency, good will and monetization of the efforts and the marketplace itself, and maybe helping also Cardano's to send and track funding for proposals.

## Our current State

After many changes on the Project Catalyst process, we have decided to stop the development of this platform, and swtiched to a more consulting type of approach providing several recommendations to create mentorship programs within the Catalyst process.

But as this effort was funded by the Catalyst community and the Cardano Treasurey, we have decided to open the code as Open Source, so anyone that wants to create a similar platform can leverage it.

Thanks so much for all the help and fun.
